# 8Vi

Name is work in progress.

This fork removes *most* of the text editing features out of 8VIM, but i want to make them configurable in the future.

#### Why? 
Because even though 8VIM makes typing on phone much more pleasant for me, I still hate typing on my phone, so i have no need for these editing features + my phone is slightly bent and sometimes it spams gestures randomly which - with editing gestures in place, results in random pasting, random tabs or the worst thing: ctrl+a and then pasting which makes it really frustrating to use (and it's the reason i made this fork).

#### What will be removed?
Basically everything that is not strictly for typing letters with these being the highest priority:

* Remove any gesture that's not used for typing letters
* Replace CTRL button with Paste Button
* Remove Tab Button
* Replace settings button with numeric keypad button

I also have plans on making everything configurable.

If you don't have any problems with your phone screen you should probably use the original [8VIM](https://github.com/flide/8VIM) as the editing gestures can 
definitely be usefull and there's probably no any other reason to use this stripped down version
